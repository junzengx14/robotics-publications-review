## Robotics Publications Review
This repository contains papers in conferences and journals of robotics research. Technical reports are also included.

## Getting started
The publications are sorted areas and subareas. For example, one conference paper could be classified as control (area) paper with contributions to hybrid systems (subarea). Journal or conference name and other keywords will be listed below each publication.

The selection of papers is inevitably biased. Please always use search engines if you would like to have a board litterature review.

## Areas and Subareas
They are listed alphabetically. Each area folder also contains one same name markdown file, where unorganized publications are put there temporarily.
* [Control](Control/Control.md)
  * [Control barrier functions](Control/ControlBarrierFunctions.md)
  * [Filtering](Control/Filtering.md)
  * [Hybrid systems](Control/HybridSystems.md)
* [Optimization](Optimization/Optimization.md)
* [Planning](Planning/Planning.md)
  * [TrajectoryOptimization](Planning/TrajectoryOptimization.md)
  * [TrajectorySmooth](Planning/TrajectorySmooth.md)
